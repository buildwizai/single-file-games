Create a complete Snake game in a single `.html` file that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, meeting the following requirements:

1. **2D Style**: Implement the game in a 2D canvas, using simple shapes (e.g., squares) for the snake and food, without any 3D effects.
2. **Retro Style**: Use a pixelated font (e.g., 'Press Start 2P' from Google Fonts), a limited color palette (e.g., black background, green snake, red food), and blocky graphics to mimic classic arcade games.
3. **Better Game Logic**: 
   - The snake moves continuously in the current direction at a set interval.
   - Eating food increases the snake's length and score, and spawns new food randomly.
   - Speed increases slightly as the score grows (with a minimum interval limit).
   - Game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
   - Include simple sound effects using the Web Audio API (e.g., high-pitched beep for eating, low-pitched tone for game over).
4. **Show Final Score**: Display the player's final score on a game over screen when the game ends.
5. **Local Score Table**: 
   - Store high scores locally in the browser using `localStorage`.
   - Maintain a list of the top 10 scores with player names and scores.
6. **Name Input and High Score Table**: 
   - Start with a screen where the player enters their name and can view the high score table.
   - The game only starts after a name is provided.
   - Display the high score table on the start screen, updated after each game if the score qualifies.
7. **Pause/Resume**: 
   - Allow pausing and resuming the game using the 'P' key (on keyboard) or a touch button (on mobile).
   - Show a pause overlay when paused.
8. **Local Storage**: Ensure all persistent data (high scores) is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

Additional Specifications:
- **Structure**: 
  - Use a `<canvas>` element for the game, with separate divs for start, pause, and game over screens.
  - Include a score display above the canvas during gameplay.
  - Add touch controls (left, right, up, down, pause) for mobile devices, visible only on small screens (e.g., via CSS media query).
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Canvas size adjusts to fit the screen (e.g., 90% of the smaller of width or height), with a fixed grid (e.g., 20x20).
  - Touch controls appear on screens smaller than 600px.
- **Styling**: 
  - Use a dark background (e.g., #333) for the page.
  - Style buttons with a green color (e.g., #4CAF50) and hover effect.
  - Overlay screens (start, pause, game over) use a semi-transparent black background (e.g., rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)).
- **Single File**: Combine all HTML, CSS (in `<style>`), and JavaScript (in `<script>`) into one `.html` file, requiring no external dependencies beyond the Google Fonts link.

Output:
- Provide the full `.html` file as a single code block that I can copy, save as `snake.html`, and run directly in a web browser.
- Ensure the code is commented to explain key sections (e.g., game loop, controls, high score handling).

The result should be a fully functional, retro-style Snake game that runs in modern browsers, supports both desktop (keyboard) and mobile (touch) input, and persists high scores locally.
