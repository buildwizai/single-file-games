## Adding a New Game

1. **Create a New Game Directory**
   - Create a new directory under `games/` with a descriptive name
   - Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `space-shooter`, `puzzle-game`)

2. **Create the Game Files**
   - Create a single HTML file for each AI model implementation
   - Name format: `<model-name>.html` (e.g., `grok3.html`, `chatgpt.html`)
   - Ensure your game is completely self-contained in a single file

3. **Add the Prompt**
   - Create a `prompt.md` file in your game directory
   - Include the original prompt used to generate the game
   - Document any modifications or additional context provided

4. **Test Your Game**
   - Ensure the game works in different browsers
   - Test on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Verify that all assets are properly embedded
